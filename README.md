# Cubic Ninja
### Multipurpose Pokemon Showdown bot written in Python (3) !

Just mess around with config.yaml to get the bot to work. I've been pretty busy with school as of late, will update this repo with further instructions later (and clean up code, lol)
# tl;dr: this probably has no use to you right now.

# dependencies
  - geopy

## to-do:
  - update README with something useful
    - list dependencies
  - clean up code

## To run:
  1. navigate into root directory
  2. `python source/main.py`
  3. magic!!!!

if you get an error or something, you're probably missing a dependency.
again, this is just a PoC release. I'll actually do something with it later/update it when I get the time

### >The code is messy
go away, I'm 15. bet you weren't programming at my age, huh?
... I'll clean it up later, though


# last thing,
###  a lot of features have not been implemented. please understand and wait a bit.
